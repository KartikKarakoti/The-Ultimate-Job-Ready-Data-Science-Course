Data Science is the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions.

Why is Data Science Important?
In today’s world, data is everywhere—from your online shopping habits to the sensors in smart devices. Companies use this data to:

Make better decisions (e.g., which product to launch next).
Predict outcomes (e.g., weather forecasts or stock prices).
Automate processes (e.g., self-driving cars).
Personalize experiences (e.g., Netflix recommendations, YouTube recommendations).
Key Steps in Data Science:
Data Collection – Gathering raw data from various sources (websites, databases, IoT devices, etc.).
Data Cleaning – Fixing errors and handling missing values (this takes up 80% of a data scientist’s time).
Data Analysis – Using statistical methods to find patterns and insights.
Model Building – Applying machine learning to make predictions.
Interpretation & Communication – Presenting findings in a clear way to help decision-making.
Where Do We See Data Science in Action?
Healthcare: Predicting disease outbreaks and improving diagnoses.
E-commerce: Personalized product recommendations.
Finance: Detecting fraudulent transactions by recognizing patterns.
Entertainment: Content recommendations on platforms like YouTube and Netflix.
